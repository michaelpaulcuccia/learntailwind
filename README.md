# learntailwind

Thank you Novo for the opportunity to discuss a potential Frontend Developer Role.

As a token of good faith and a demonstration of my interest, I created this "quick and dirty" replica of your application, as shown in the screenshots on your website.

This is my first time working with Tailwind and I found it to be very similar to how Bootstrap uses classes to style elements. While I haven't mastered this technology overnight, I definitely developed an interest and found the documentation easy to follow and implement.
